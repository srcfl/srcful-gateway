## Detailed Results

### ROB-001, ROB-002 & ROB-013 Network and Inverter Connection Recovery
**Test Setup**:
- Blixt running in local development environment
- Connected to real inverter via internet-based VPN at remote site
- Wifi connection to local network
- System in normal operation state

**Test Steps**:
1. System running normally with active inverter connection through VPN
2. Disabled wifi on test computer
3. Monitored system behavior during disconnect
4. Re-enabled wifi
5. Observed recovery process

**Observed Behavior**:
- System detected network loss
- Lost both internet and VPN connection to inverter
- Gracefully handled both connection losses
- Maintained system stability during offline period
- Automatically reconnected to internet when wifi restored
- Automatically reconnected to inverter through VPN
- Normal operations resumed without manual intervention

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✓ System remained stable during disconnect
- ✓ Proper handling of both internet and inverter disconnection
- ✓ Automatic recovery of both connections when network restored
- ✓ No manual intervention required
- ✓ Normal operation resumed seamlessly

## System Metrics

### Resource Usage
- System remained stable throughout test
- No resource spikes observed during disconnect/reconnect
- Normal operation maintained during all phases

## Test Spec Improvements

1. Add specific test case for VPN-based inverter connections
2. Include metrics for reconnection time for both internet and inverter
3. Add monitoring of inverter communication state during disconnect
4. Specify expected behavior for different network interface types (wifi vs ethernet)
5. Add test scenarios for VPN-based inverter connections in ROB-013

## Reproducibility

To reproduce this test:
1. Set up Blixt in local development environment
2. Establish VPN connection to remote inverter over internet
3. Ensure system is in normal operation
4. Disable wifi on test computer
5. Monitor system behavior
6. Re-enable wifi
7. Verify recovery of both internet and inverter connections

## Follow-up Actions

1. [ ] Add specific wifi disconnect test case to specification
2. [ ] Implement reconnection time monitoring
3. [ ] Test with different network interface types
4. [ ] Add metrics collection for network state transitions
5. [ ] Add VPN-based inverter connection scenarios to ROB-013
