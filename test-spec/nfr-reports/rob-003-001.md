## Detailed Results

### ROB-003 Local Interface Operation During Internet Outage
**Test Setup**:
- Blixt gateway running in normal operation
- Unifi Dream Machine router with WAN Fiber converter
- MacBook for testing local access
- Active solar production during test
- Battery system available for control testing

**Test Steps**:
1. System running normally with internet connectivity
2. Disconnected ethernet cable to WAN Fiber converter (cutting house internet)
3. Verified complete internet outage using Chrome browser on MacBook
4. Accessed blixt.local interface via local network
5. Monitored real-time data updates in local UI
6. Tested CONTROL mode functionality (battery charge/discharge)
7. Performed multiple hard reloads (Shift+R) to test interface stability
8. Tested API endpoint (blixt.local/api/dee)
9. Reconnected internet and repeated local interface testing
10. Verified continued functionality after internet restoration

**Observed Behavior**:
- ✓ Local interface (blixt.local) remained fully accessible during internet outage
- ✓ Real-time data updates continued at ~1 second intervals
- ✓ Load power and solar production values updating correctly
- ✓ CONTROL mode fully functional - could charge and discharge battery
- ✓ UI remained stable through multiple hard reloads
- ✓ API endpoint (blixt.local/api/dee) returned same values as UI
- ✓ All functionality maintained after internet reconnection
- ✓ Local interface performance unchanged by internet connectivity status

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✓ Local interface accessible during complete internet outage
- ✓ Real-time data collection and display continues offline
- ✓ Battery control functionality operates independent of internet
- ✓ UI stability maintained during network transitions
- ✓ API endpoints respond correctly in offline mode
- ✓ No degradation of local functionality
- ✓ Seamless operation across internet disconnect/reconnect cycles

## System Metrics

### Local Interface Performance
- Data refresh rate: ~1 second (consistent)
- UI responsiveness: No degradation observed
- Control commands: Immediate response
- API response time: Normal (same as with internet)

### Network Isolation
- Complete isolation from external networks confirmed
- Local network communication unaffected
- Gateway maintained local service availability

## Test Environment Details

**Network Setup**:
- Router: Unifi Dream Machine
- WAN: Fiber converter connection
- Test device: MacBook with Chrome browser
- Local network: Maintained during internet outage

**System State**:
- Solar production: Active during test
- Battery system: Available and responsive to control
- Load monitoring: Continuous operation

## Test Spec Improvements

1. Add formal ROB-003 test case for local operation during internet outage
2. Define expected data refresh rates for offline operation
3. Specify control functionality requirements during network isolation
4. Add API endpoint testing requirements for offline mode
5. Include UI stability testing procedures (hard reload scenarios)

## Reproducibility

To reproduce this test:
1. Ensure Blixt gateway is in normal operation with solar/battery system
2. Set up test device on same local network as gateway
3. Disconnect internet at router level (WAN disconnection)
4. Verify complete internet outage from test device
5. Access blixt.local interface
6. Monitor real-time data updates for several minutes
7. Test control functionality (battery charge/discharge)
8. Perform multiple hard reloads of interface
9. Test API endpoints (e.g., blixt.local/api/dee)
10. Reconnect internet and verify continued operation

## Follow-up Actions

1. [ ] Add ROB-003 specification for local operation testing
2. [ ] Define minimum acceptable data refresh rates for offline mode
3. [ ] Document expected behavior for all local endpoints during outage
4. [ ] Add automated testing for local interface availability
5. [ ] Create checklist for local functionality validation
