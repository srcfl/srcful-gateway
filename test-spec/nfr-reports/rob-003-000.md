**Date**: 2024-06-12  
**Tester**: Fredrik  
**Location**: Fredrik's home  
**Firmware Version**: Development Build LFG branch 
**Test Focus**: Local Interface Operation During Internet Outage  
**Test Duration**: ~30 minutes

## Test Summary Table

| Test ID | Variant | Result | Comment |
|:--------|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| ROB-003 | Local interface during internet outage | FAIL | Server container behaved strangely, seemed to reset and restart. |

## Detailed Results

### ROB-003 Local Interface Operation During Internet Outage
**Test Setup**:
- Blixt gateway running in normal operation
- Unifi Dream Machine router with WAN Fiber converter
- MacBook for testing local access
- Active solar production during test
- Battery system available for control testing

**Test Steps**:
1. System running normally with internet connectivity
2. Disconnected ethernet cable to WAN Fiber converter (cutting house internet)
3. Verified complete internet outage using Chrome browser on MacBook
4. Accessed blixt.local interface via local network
5. Monitored real-time data updates in local UI
6. Tested CONTROL mode functionality (battery charge/discharge)
7. Performed multiple hard reloads (Shift+R) to test interface stability
8. Tested API endpoint (blixt.local/api/dee)
9. Reconnected internet and repeated local interface testing
10. Verified continued functionality after internet restoration

**Observed Behavior**:
- ✓ Local interface (blixt.local) remained fully accessible during internet outage
- ✓ Real-time data updates did NOT work, server container seemed to restart or not respond continously.
- ✓ Local traefic container dashboard seemed to work.


**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✓ Local interface accessible during complete internet outage


## System Metrics

### Local Interface Performance
- Data refresh rate: No
- UI responsiveness: UI itself responsice but data from server was not working.
- Control commands: Unresponsive
- API response time: Unresponsive

### Network Isolation
- Complete isolation from external networks confirmed


## Test Environment Details

**Network Setup**:
- Router: Unifi Dream Machine
- WAN: Fiber converter connection
- Test device: MacBook with Chrome browser
- Local network: Maintained during internet outage

**System State**:
- Solar production: Active during test
- Battery system: Available and responsive to control
- Load monitoring: Continuous operation

## Test Spec Improvements

1. Add formal ROB-003 test case for local operation during internet outage
2. Define expected data refresh rates for offline operation
3. Specify control functionality requirements during network isolation
4. Add API endpoint testing requirements for offline mode
5. Include UI stability testing procedures (hard reload scenarios)

## Reproducibility

To reproduce this test:
1. Ensure Blixt gateway is in normal operation with solar/battery system
2. Set up test device on same local network as gateway
3. Disconnect internet at router level (WAN disconnection)
4. Verify complete internet outage from test device
5. Access blixt.local interface
6. Monitor real-time data updates for several minutes
7. Test control functionality (battery charge/discharge)
8. Perform multiple hard reloads of interface
9. Test API endpoints (e.g., blixt.local/api/dee)
10. Reconnect internet and verify continued operation

## Follow-up Actions

1. [ ] Try to reproduce this behavior.
